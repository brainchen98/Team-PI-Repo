# *Team PI Teensy Sketchbook*
[pi.bbcrobotics.org](http://pi.bbcrobotics.org/)

Programs are written for Arduino 1.0.x.

master; slave1; slave2; and slave3 are the actual programs used on each individual Teensy on the robot. Other programs which were used in the development process for debugging/testing snippets of code can be found in the folder *Tests*. You may find interesting programs in there, such as arrayShift which is a program that plays with shifting elements of arrays up and down (and was ultimately implemented in the TSOP library found in the libraries repo).

For our libraries (which most of thse programs are dependent on), see our libraries repository.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
